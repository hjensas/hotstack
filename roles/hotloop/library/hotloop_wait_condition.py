short_description: Execute a wait condition command with retry logic

version_added: "2.8"

description:
    - |
      Executes a wait condition command with built-in retry logic for common
      Kubernetes/OpenShift transient errors. This module handles the retry
      logic internally while allowing the Ansible task to loop over multiple
      wait conditions for better visibility.

options:
  command:
    description:
      - The wait condition command to execute (typically an 'oc wait' command)
    type: str
    required: true
  retries:
    description:
      - Number of retries for transient errors
    type: int
    default: 50
  delay:
    description:
      - Delay in seconds between retries
    type: int
    default: 5
